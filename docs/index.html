        <p>"Ansh, do you remember how we first met? It was back in the 4th semester, and I was still the quiet type guy
          —
          nothing like now. We were all learning the basics of web design with HTML & CSS and you were already friends
          with Ashwin. One day, you found out I was also interested in coding and that I knew a bit about it, too.
          That's when you started talking to me. We dove into discussions about HTML and CSS, exploring new elements,
          their implementations, and creating all kinds of simple login forms together. We had so much fun, learning and
          laughing along the way. I think that's when our core skills in HTML and CSS really took shape, and so did our
          friendship. (Now... turn the page!)"</p>

        <h2 class="page-title">Second Memory</h2>
        <p>"After the 4th semester, the real fun kicked in during 5th semester—that's when our friendship became ultra
          pro max strong. Do you remember how we started studying Java then? We just nailed it, grabbing concepts and
          codes so fast, making program after program. Then, near the end of the semester, Rashmi ma'am introduced us to
          Java AWT for GUI creation. Oh man, that's when things got serious! We decided to make a GUI calculator using
          Java AWT, and you even introduced me to Java Swing. We dove right in and had a working GUI calculator in about
          11 days. I'll never forget that moment when we showed it to ma'am, and she told the whole class, ‘Everyone
          should learn from these boys—they created a GUI calculator in just 10-11 days!' That's when we realized our
          duo, our project partnership, was something special—or in my words, "Zahar". And that same year, when HOD sir
          mentioned making teams for a major project, we were ready to dive in, as always. And that's how our life
          biggest project journey really began." </p>
