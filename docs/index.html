        <p>"Ansh, do you remember how we first met? It was back in the 4th semester, and I was still the quiet type guy
          —
          nothing like now. We were all learning the basics of web design with HTML & CSS and you were already friends
          with Ashwin. One day, you found out I was also interested in coding and that I knew a bit about it, too.
          That's when you started talking to me. We dove into discussions about HTML and CSS, exploring new elements,
          their implementations, and creating all kinds of simple login forms together. We had so much fun, learning and
          laughing along the way. I think that's when our core skills in HTML and CSS really took shape, and so did our
          friendship. (Now... turn the page!)"</p>

        <h2 class="page-title">Second Memory</h2>
        <p>"After the 4th semester, the real fun kicked in during 5th semester—that's when our friendship became ultra
          pro max strong. Do you remember how we started studying Java then? We just nailed it, grabbing concepts and
          codes so fast, making program after program. Then, near the end of the semester, Rashmi ma'am introduced us to
          Java AWT for GUI creation. Oh man, that's when things got serious! We decided to make a GUI calculator using
          Java AWT, and you even introduced me to Java Swing. We dove right in and had a working GUI calculator in about
          11 days. I'll never forget that moment when we showed it to ma'am, and she told the whole class, ‘Everyone
          should learn from these boys—they created a GUI calculator in just 10-11 days!' That's when we realized our
          duo, our project partnership, was something special—or in my words, "Zahar". And that same year, when HOD sir
          mentioned making teams for a major project, we were ready to dive in, as always. And that's how our life
          biggest project journey really began." </p>

        <h2 class="page-title">Third Memory</h2>
        <p>"At the end of 5th semester, we faced a real challenge: submitting the synopsis for our major project in the
          software engineering practical. The twist? Our project wasn’t even built or started yet! But we managed to
          pull it off, and it was epic. The whole class was buzzing about who would go first for the viva in HOD sir’s
          office, and we just jumped in like, ‘aag laga denge!’ And it went great, honestly.

          The best part was how we even came up with the idea for our project. The credit goes to Sakshi ma’am, who
          casually suggested us to make an app like Sarthak. So we thought, ‘Why not make it better?’ And that’s how
          'TIME
          TRACKER' was born. And of course, a big thanks goes to your mom, Ansh, who even gave our app its name! It felt
          like our big moment."</p>

        <h2 class="page-title">Fourth Memory</h2>
        <p>"January. When we started working on the login and account creation forms using a local
          database. Remember how we created so many different layouts and styles? The real challenge was connecting to
          the database—storing and fetching data was so tough at first since we were beginners. But we learned! We got
          everything connected, from storing login details in sessions for user identification to setting up the main
          features.

          While I was working on the connection, you designed an awesome-looking homepage with useful tabs and also the
          'My Profile' tab, while I worked on the 'Change Password' page, inspired by Epic Games’ layout. I
          even created a 'Forgot Password' page that sent recovery emails to users’ entered addresses. By the time I
          finished those, you had completed the homepage, and it looked amazing! It took us nearly three months
          (January to March)"
